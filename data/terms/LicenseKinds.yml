- term: CC_BY-NC
  label: CC BY-NC
  definition: The Attribution-NonCommercial License lets others remix, tweak, and
    build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also
    acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don't have to license their derivative
    works on the same terms.
  source_uri: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
- term: CC_BY
  label: CC BY
  definition: The Attribution License lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build
    upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original
    creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for
    maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials.

- term: CC_BY-SA
  label: CC BY-SA
  definition: The Attribution-ShareAlike License lets others remix, tweak, and build
    upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license
    their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared
    to "copyleft" free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours
    will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use.
