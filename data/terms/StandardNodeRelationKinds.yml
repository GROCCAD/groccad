terms:
  - term: exactMatch
    label: Exact Match
    definition: The source node and the target standard node are the same (identical standard nodes in different versions of a document).
    source_uri: http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#exactMatch
  - term: exactAlignment
    label: Exact Alignment
    definition: The source and target standard nodes describe the same competency.
    source_uri: http://purl.org/ASN/schema/core/exactAlignment
  - term: majorAlignment
    label: Major Alignment
    definition: Major overlap of relevant concepts between the source and target standard nodes.
    source_uri: http://purl.org/ASN/schema/core/majorAlignment
  - term: minorAlignment
    label: Minor Alignment
    definition: Minor overlap of relevant concepts between the source and target standard nodes.
    source_uri: http://purl.org/ASN/schema/core/minorAlignment
  - term: broadAlignment
    label: Broad Alignment
    definition: The source standard node is aligned to a subset of the target standard node.
    source_uri: http://purl.org/ASN/schema/core/broadAlignment
    notes: >
      The target standard node covers all of the relevant concepts in the source
      standard node as well as concepts not found in the source standard node.
  - term: narrowAlignment
    label: Narrow Alignment
    definition: The target standard node is aligned to a subset of the source standard node.
    source_uri: http://purl.org/ASN/schema/core/narrowAlignment
    notes: >
      The source standard node covers all of the relevant concepts in the target
      standard node as well as concepts not found in the target standard node.
  - term: prerequisiteAlignment
    label: Prerequisite Alignment
    definition: The source standard node is a prerequisite to the target standard node.
    source_uri: http://purl.org/ASN/schema/core/prerequisiteAlignment
  - term: related
    label: Related
    definition: The source and target standard node are related.
