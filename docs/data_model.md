ROC Data Model
==============

The Repository of Organized Curriculums (ROC) data model is heavily inspired by
the following prior work:
 - ASN + CASE schemas for curriculum standards
 - ASN and LRMI specifications for content correlations
 - The Studio/Kolibri data model for content collections (channels) and content nodes

The best way to understand the properties of of the ROC data model is to trace
the "import schema" statements by looking at schema comparison spreadsheets:
 - StandardsDocument = https://learningequality.org/r/std-doc-model
 - StandardNode = https://learningequality.org/r/std-node-model
 - StandardNodeRelation = https://learningequality.org/r/std-node-rels
