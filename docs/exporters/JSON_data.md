JSON Data
=========

Every resource on a ROC data server is accessible as JSON data. For example the
Term "Mathematics" within the Ghana:Subjects controlled vocabulary identified by the URI
[https://rocdata.global/Ghana/terms/Subjects/Mathematics](https://rocdata.global/Ghana/terms/Subjects/Mathematics) (official identifier),
can be accessed as JSON data at
[https://rocdata.global/Ghana/terms/Subjects/Mathematics.json](https://rocdata.global/Ghana/terms/Subjects/Mathematics.json)
for use in frontend applications and mobile apps.


Usage
-----
Just append `.json` to any canonical URI within the ROC server to obtain the
JSON representation of this resource.
