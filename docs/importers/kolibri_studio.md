Kolibri Studio channel content collections
==========================================

[Kolibri Studio](https://kolibri-studio.readthedocs.io/) is a general purpose
editor for Kolibri channels, which allows curriculum designers and educators to
retain, reuse, revise, remix, and redistribute the educational learning resources
available in the [Kolibri Content Library](https://catalog.learningequality.org/).

Kolibri Studio is often used to for curriculum alignment of learning resources,
by re-organizing them into a folder structure (topics and subtopics) that matches
the structure of local curriculum standards in a given country.

The structure of content of a Studio channels is similar to the information
available in a [Kolibri database](./kolibri_db.md), but contains additional
information about content provenance (where was the content was imported form),
and `source_domain` and `source_id` properties for each content node, and
`source_url` fields for each file.
